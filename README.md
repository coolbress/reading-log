# reading-log

> One line saying what this is.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone <this repository>
cd reading-log
uv sync --locked   # 1. dependencies, the same command CI runs; the lockfile is used as is
uv run pytest      # 2. tests
```

## Developing

```bash
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format .   # lint and format
uv run mypy .                                  # types
uv run pytest                                  # tests
uv build                                       # build
```

CI runs each of these as a separate check, plus a secret scan and CodeQL.
Pass them locally first. The list of required checks is the repository's
ruleset, so it is not repeated here.

## Configuration

Copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) to `.env` and fill in the values.
**`.env` is never committed.**

## Contributing

[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md), in particular the test policy. `main` is
protected; a change lands as a pull request with green checks.
